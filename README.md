# Algorithms and Data Structures Review

In an effort to better prepare for interviews and up my technical programming,
I've started this project with the goal of coding as many classic algorithms,
data structures, or algorithms/data structures problems as I can per day.

### What's inside
Each folder contains a certain type of problem from a classic data structure
type or algorithmic paradigm. All are coded in C, C++, or Python 3.

### Goals
The goal is to code and solve problems or otherwise implement solutions
every day for at least two to three hours. Stay tuned as I progress,
learn, and continue to update this repository with more and more of what I
learn and do!
